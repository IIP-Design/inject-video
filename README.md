# Inject Video

jQuery plugin that replaces a placeholder image with YouTube video.


## Instructions

YouTube autogenerates thumbnails for a given video, which you can access
via the following url: `http://img.youtube.com/vi/<video id>/<thumbnail quality>`

The video ID is everything after the "=" in a video's URL. For example,
given the following URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C175zW8-6j8, the
video ID would be `C175zW8-6j8`.

Thumbnail quality options:

* default.jpg (aspect ratio: 4x3),
* sddefault.jpg (aspect ratio: 4x3),
* mqdefault.jpg (aspect ratio: 16:9),
* hqdefault.jpg (aspect ratio: 4x3),
* maxresdefault.jpg (aspect ratio: 16:9)
